        <h2 id="title3a">Why we chose this</h2>
        <p>We chose to advocate for sustainable energy because it is the key to a cleaner, safer, and better future. 
            Energies such as solar, wind, and hydropower come from natural sources that do not run out and aren't harmful to the environment. 
            Unlike fossil fuels that cause pollution and climate change, it helps reduce carbon emissions and keeps our planet healthy. 
            By supporting sustainable energy, we also promote energy independence and economic growth. 
            Additionally, it creates green jobs, helps communities save money for electricity, and provides access to power in remote areas.
            Using renewable sources ensures that as years fly by, we can safely enjoy the air we breathe, the water we drink, the nature we preserved, and the climate around us.
            <br><br>
            To conclude, advocating for this means choosing to care for ourselves and the planet we live in. 
            It is our responsibility to preserve the Earth, and shifting our energy sources is one of the best ways of doing so.
            Together, we can make a positive impact and build a brighter and more sustainable world for everyone.

        <h2>Facts about clean energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The sun provides more energy to Earth in one hour than humanity uses in a year.</li>
            <li>A single wind turbine powers 1,500-2,000 homes per year.</li>
            <li>Geothermal energy is one of the most reliable renewable sources because it can't be affected by weather</li>
            <li>Modern wind turbines can be as tall as the Statue of Liberty</li>

        <h2 id="title3b">Realization</h2>
        <p>After my team and I learned and understood the importance of sustainable and renewable energy, we realized how much it could change the world for the better. 
            Any way of supporting clean energy projects, saving electricity, or spreading awareness can make a difference. 
            If we continue to rely on fossil fuels, we harm not only the environment but also our future. 
            <br><br>
            Advocating for sustainable energy also made us appreciate how connected we all are to nature.
            The sun shining on us, the wind dancing around us, and the water flowing with us are all gifts from nature that can provide endless energy when used wisely. 
            True progress is not measured by how much was done, but by how well we preserve and share what we have. 
            In the end, advocating for sustainable energy makes us care for ourselves, protect nature, and ensure a better world. 
            Change starts with awareness, but true impact begins when we take action.
